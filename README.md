# Turn-a-Macbook-Into-a-Linux-File-Server
A fun project I did where I took an old Macbook I had and turned it into a Linux server that can be used for a file server, a personal VPN, or whatever else strikes your fancy.

This was done on a 2015 Intel Macbook Pro 13". Instructions for M1 Macs will likely be different.

This project sets up a Debian 12 Stable system with no Desktop Enviroment. Default install takes up about 200MB of ram, leaving plenty of headroom to do whatever else you like.
It also goes over how to control keyboard and screen backlights, as well as disabling the lid, so that the laptop can be closed, put on a shelf, and just accessed through SSH.
